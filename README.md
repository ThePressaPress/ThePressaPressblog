# BlogKit

## Setup
First and most obvious of all: run `npm i`  
Next, Create a [sanity CMS](https://sanity.io) account.  
When the Sanity CLI asks you where you want your sanity studio project, you can answer with any file/folder, it doesnt even have to be in this folder, as long as you remember where it is, youll need it to create posts.  
In another editor window, enter the folder you have just created. Delete the schemas folder and replace it with the template one in this project folder.
